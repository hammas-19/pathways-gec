        <h2 class="mb-8 text-center">A Promise Born from Personal Experience</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 space-y-6">
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            It was 2015. Three young medical students sat in a cramped dormitory room in Jingzhou, China, thousands of miles away from home. They had just received a distressing call from a fellow Pakistani student who had been scammed by an education agent—his savings gone, his dreams shattered, and his family devastated.
          </p>

          <p>
            That night, Dr. Sohail, Dr. Amir, and Dr. Adnan made a promise. A promise that once they completed their MBBS degrees, they would create something different. Something honest. Something that would ensure no student would ever feel alone, scared, or cheated when pursuing their dreams of studying abroad.
          </p>

          <p>
            They themselves had experienced the challenges firsthand—the language barriers, the cultural shock, the homesickness, and the uncertainty that comes with being in a foreign land. But they also experienced the beauty of it—the world-class education, the friendships that transcended borders, the confidence that came from becoming doctors in one of the world's most advanced medical education systems.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold text-xl text-primary">
            In 2017, Global Educational Consultants (GEC) was born—not as a business, but as a promise kept.
          </p>

          <p>
            The three founding members didn't have fancy offices or big marketing budgets. What they had was something more valuable—genuine experience, honest intentions, and an unshakeable commitment to treating every student like their own younger sibling.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first year was challenging. They personally picked up students from the airport at midnight, helped them shop for groceries, taught them how to use WeChat, and held their hands through every moment of uncertainty. They didn't do it for profit—they did it because they remembered how it felt to be that scared 18-year-old arriving in a foreign country.
          </p>

          <p>
            Word spread. Parents began calling from Pakistan, saying "I heard about these young doctors who actually care." Students who successfully enrolled started referring their friends, saying "These guys are different—they actually respond to messages at 2 AM when you're having a panic attack."
          </p>

          <p>
            By 2018, GEC had grown beyond the three founders. They brought in counselors, visa specialists, and support staff—but with one non-negotiable rule: everyone must treat students with the same care they would want for their own family members.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold">
            Today, GEC has a team of 50+ dedicated professionals. But we've never forgotten our roots. We've never forgotten that promise made in a dormitory room in 2015.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-light-grey p-8 rounded-xl my-8">
            <p class="text-xl italic text-center">
              "Every time a student successfully lands in China and sends us a photo with their thumbs up, we remember why we started this. It was never about building an empire. It was about ensuring no student ever feels alone on their journey to achieving their dreams."
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt-4 font-semibold">— Dr. Sohail Ahmed, Co-Founder, GEC</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Today, GEC has guided 5000+ students to top universities in China. But more importantly, we've created 5000+ success stories, 5000+ families who trust us, and 5000+ young professionals who are now living their dreams—many of them doctors, engineers, and business leaders making a difference in the world.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">
            We're not just education consultants. We're the family you didn't know you'd find on your journey to China. We're the voice that reassures you when doubt creeps in. We're the team that celebrates your admission like it's our own achievement.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg">
            This is GEC. This is our promise. This is why students don't just choose us—they trust us with their futures.
